# todo list for the multiplane calibration

introduction
multiplane calibration logic is the following: 
- create parameter sets per each plane (see test_multiplane or multiplane_calibration)
- in these sets, set "calibrate from Z" to 1 and "combine" to 0
- in each plane do calibration on a 2D target, save .crd and .fix files 
* todo discover what are these files and who writes them? python/liboptv/cython? 
- create additional parameter set, called multiplane or combination
- in this set, set "calibrate from Z" to 1 and "combine" to 1
- create parameters/multi_planes.par - not yet in GUI 
* todo - think if we need it in GUI
* todo - think how to do it in GUI
- load image (whatever plane), regular procedure (detection, ...) then directly to 
Raw orientation - if both examine parameters are set to 1, then do the following: (*todo)

    - read the multi_planes.par
    - from each multi plane folder (according to the list in the par file): 
        a) read crd and fix
        b) combine this info into a 3D calibration target (virtual 3d target) and virtual points
        c) run the usual Raw Orientation and then Fine Orientation
        
    this step is identical to pbi/ptv/multiplane.py
